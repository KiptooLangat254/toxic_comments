# toxic_comments
 I Used Natural language Processing to clean input data to remove stopwords, punctuations, stem and lemmatize input data. Using a saved TDIF vectorizer, changed the input data to vectors and Machine learning algorithm(Linear SVC) to predict if a comment is toxic or not. The model had a F1 accuracy of 71%. Deployment was done using streamlit.
